# ipay-ghana-wordpress
Receive online payments on your WordPress site in Ghana.

### What is this plugin all about?
This is a plugin to integrate into your WordPress website and enable you receive payments online from your customers.
The plugin gathers some simple information from your customer about the item, product, or service to be paid for and redirects them to iPay CheckOut page in order to complete the payment process securely.

### Do I need something in order to use it?
Yes. It's nothing much. All you need is a WordPress powered website (whether on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) or self-hosted version downloaded from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/download/)).
Provided you have the right to install plugins, it's a straight forward process. 

Otherwise, you should contact your site administrator for assistance.

### How do I intall it?
There are several options you can choose from to getting iPay Ghana WordPress plugin installed. Select the option that suits you best, depending on your preferences, access level to your server or WordPress user account priviledges.

### Awesome! I'm done with the installation; what's next?
Nothing much. :-) Do navigate to the iPay Ghana WordPress plugin Settings page under your Settings menu from your Dashboard. There, you will basically have to provide your Merchant Key, select and set the invoice ID type to use, provide your SUCCESS/CANCEL URLs (optional) and hit on the "Save" button to update your parameters.

That tells us the account belongs to you only.

### I do not have a Merchant key. How do I get one?
Visit our [get started](https://manage.ipaygh.com/xmanage/get-started/) page and sign up with the easy steps provided.

### Do I need to pay something before opening an account?
A BIG no. You don't have to pay anything in order to set up your merchant account; it's absolutely free.
